# 🚦 SmartQueue  
### AI-Powered Intelligent Queue Management System

SmartQueue is a lightweight, real-time, AI-driven queue management platform designed to **reduce waiting time, balance crowd load, and improve user experience** in campuses and public spaces.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Queues in canteens, events, hospitals, and offices are:
- Inefficient and unpredictable  
- Manually managed or static  
- Frustrating for users  
- Poorly optimized for peak hours  

Most systems only **display queue length** — they don’t **optimize** it.

## 💡 Solution Overview
SmartQueue uses **AI + real-time data** to:
- Predict waiting time
- Balance queue load dynamically
- Notify users exactly when to arrive

The system intelligently decides **who should wait, who should come later, and when the queue is optimal**.
